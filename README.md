**Known Issues**:
- In Friend function, I can't put it in main.cpp, so I have to change implement from main to Item.cpp and I want to separate between Weapon and Protect gear to different function.
- I copy from all lab so not really much things go to error 
- About new update for Cmake list I separate between test and run program because otherwise it will fall to run a test.
