# Checkpoint 1 Reflection

## What I Implemented
- ✅ Add reduce damage function
- ✅ Add Map, only player on it
- ✅ Add Player and use inheritance from Character
- ✅ Add sword and armor(Protect_gear) in Item
- ✅ Add Inventory and put Item in Inventory
- ✅ Add Test without if else and add explain more reasonable.
- ✅ Add enemy and NPC in map
- ✅ Add interact with NPC
- ✅ Add combat with enemy

## Challenges I Faced
- I got a huge buggy in Inventory but before solve it I thought It's in Game or map or Enemy. But actually it's in Inventory when I try to add more attackBonus and defendBonus
- about the buggy I use getAttackBonus for attack bonus and defend bonus (I'm lazy) but before that happen I separate it and forgot that (Tehee)

## What I Learned
[What new concepts or techniques did you learn?]
- Not much because I want to make sure everything from basic work fine before getting something new 
- when I try to interact with NPC, it's instantly happen and deleted so I create wait for key to make it stop 
- same with combat(enemy) but I will implement it for next checkpoint.

## Testing Results
[Summarize your test cases and what you learned from testing]
I use chatGPT to write test only
Everything I explain is in Test2.cpp

## Questions for Next Checkpoint
[Any questions about implementation, features, or code design?]
My aim for code design is to help it easy to read and easy to understand how my code work, this is my first step to let me understand foundation of C++.
