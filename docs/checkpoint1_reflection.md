# Checkpoint 1 Reflection

## What I Implemented
- ✅ Add reduce damage function
- ✅ Add Map, only player on it
- ✅ Add Player and use inheritance from Character
- ✅ Add sword and armor(Protect_gear) in Item
- ✅ Add Inventory and put Item in Inventory
- ✅ Add Test without if else and add explain more reasonable.

## Challenges I Faced
-pretty much time I have spent is figure out error from Cmake list, Friend function and add new function for Protect Gear
-First I add test.cpp in CmakeLists, but it doesn't work.
-Because I copy from all lab so not too much challenges

## What I Learned
[What new concepts or techniques did you learn?]
-switch case with ItemType and how really friend function work
-at first, I didn't know that I can separate executable in CmakeLists. But after thinking and searching on internet(chatCBT). I figure out the way to explore more way to use CmakeLists as running command.
-Because I added Protect Gear so that I need to addDefenseBonus item into inventory to let it countItem.

## Testing Results
[Summarize your test cases and what you learned from testing]
Everything I explain is in test.cpp

## Questions for Next Checkpoint
[Any questions about implementation, features, or code design?]
My aim for code design is to help it easy to read and easy to understand how my code work, this is my first step to let me understand foundation of C++.

## Time Spent
Approximately 7 hours and 30mins include eat and entertainment( got distracted and delay)
